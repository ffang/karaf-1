# This file contains initial configadmin configuration for org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn PID
# It should be noted that before configadmin service updates the PID (which reconfigures pax-url-aether bundle),
# pax-url-aether uses default configuration that is available in etc/config.properties

# If set to true, the following property will not allow any certificate to be used

# Path to the local Maven settings file.
# The repositories defined in this file will be automatically added to the list
# of default repositories if the 'org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories' property

# The following locations are checked for the existence of the settings.xml file
#   * 1. looks for the specified url
#   * 2. if not found looks for ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml
#   * 3. if not found looks for ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml
#   * 4. if not found looks for ${M2_HOME}/conf/settings.xml

# leaving this option commented makes the system dependent on external configuration, which is not always desired
# "localRepository" is the target location for artifacts downloaded from "remote repositories", it's not
